# ale_norminette
Ale linter for the new norminette (https://github.com/42School/norminette)

Only works with norm version 3.

This linter needs [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) (Asynchronous Linting Engine). Go use that if you're still spending time switching between Vim and the shell. 

If you've installed ALE with [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) just copy `norminette.vim` into `~/.vim/plugged/ale/ale_linters/c/` directory or `~/.config/nvim/plugged/ale/ale_linters/c` if you are using Neovim.

If you have installed ALE with another method you'll be able to find the equivalent path in `~/.vim/`

Good luck
